# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Business Analytics and Computer Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to be able to have the skill to use data to make data-driven decisions and solve analytical problems and utilise this skill in my future career.
- I am interested in learning about the different steps involved in processing data and how to interpret and communicate findings.
