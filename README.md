# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Business Analytics and Computer Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to be able to have the skill to use data to make data-driven decisions and solve analytical problems and utilise this skill in my future career.
- I am interested in learning about the different steps involved in processing data and how to interpret and communicate findings.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![Me after 5 minutes of studying](https://nz.pinterest.com/pin/me-after-5-minutes-of-studying--2744449753247914/)
