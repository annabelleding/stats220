## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

1. I am in my fourth (and final) year of my Bachelors degree in *Business Analytics* and *Computer Science*.
2. Badminton is my favourite sport, and I love to watch the games of the top players: [https://www.youtube.com/@bwftv](https://www.youtube.com/@bwftv).
3. I am taking **STATS 220** because I want to get better at R, as well as gain the skills to make data-driven decisions and solve analytical problems.
4. I am interested in learning about the different steps involved in processing data and how to interpret and communicate findings.

Here's what I'm enjoying about this course so far:

- The lectures are really fun and engaging
- The course book and lab tasks are explained well and are laid out in a way that's easy to understand
- Who wouldn't love a course where you can make memes and gifs as an assignment
